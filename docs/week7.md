## Key Learning Outcomes

Through this coursework, the following key skills were developed:

- Understanding of Linux operating system architecture and administration
- Secure remote system management using SSH
- Application of security hardening techniques including firewalls, AppArmor, and intrusion prevention
- Use of automation scripts for system auditing and monitoring
- Performance testing and analysis under controlled workloads

---

## Challenges Encountered

Several challenges were encountered during the coursework, including:

- Initial SSH connectivity and firewall configuration issues
- Permission and privilege management when running security tools
- Network configuration differences when changing hardware environments
- Interpreting performance metrics produced by monitoring tools

Each issue was resolved through systematic troubleshooting, reinforcing the importance of methodical problem-solving in system administration.

## Evaluation of Technical Decisions

Key technical decisions included:

- Using Ubuntu Server LTS for stability and long-term support
- Applying a defence-in-depth approach to system security
- Separating security auditing from runtime performance monitoring
- Using controlled and repeatable performance tests for analysis

These decisions contributed to a stable, secure, and measurable system environment.

## Reflection

This module demonstrated the interconnected nature of operating system components, where changes to security, networking, or workload directly influence system behaviour. The combination of practical configuration tasks and analytical evaluation provided a realistic insight into real-world system administration practices.
